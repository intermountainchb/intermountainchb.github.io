							                    process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
							                <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
							                <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see&nbsp;<em>Request erasure</em>&nbsp;below for further information.</p>
							                <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
							                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">9. Your legal rights</h4>
							                <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:</p>
							                <p>Whether you are a customer or a third-party service provider, agent or contractor, you have the right to request that we update, correct, or delete (assuming that this does not impact the services we are providing to you) your personal data at any
							                    time. We may reject requests which risk the privacy of others or are unreasonable or repetitive, or would require disproportionate effort. Unless you request us to delete your data, we may keep your personal data for a period consistent with our
							                    Document Retention Policy (but we typically keep your personal data no longer than is reasonably necessary given the purposes for which the data was collected).</p>
							                <p>You have the right to opt out of the use or collection of certain data by us or by third parties, including personal data and non-personal data, by sending an email to:&nbsp;dpo@freightlink.net</p>
							                <p>You have the right to opt-out of receiving our email newsletters, bulletins, or other information at any time by following the instructions in the relevant unsubscribe process outlined in the applicable email or newsletter. Please be aware that
							                    our emails may include important or useful information about the products or services that we are providing you, including information about your shipment(s) or the status of your work orders or credit accounts.</p>
							                <p>&nbsp;</p>
							                <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact the data privacy manager.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>No fee usually required</strong>
							                </p>
							                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply
							                    with your request in these circumstances.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>What we may need from you</strong>
							                </p>
							                <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not
							                    disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Time limit to respond</strong>
							                </p>
							                <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

							                    <strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong>
							                </p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>&nbsp;means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any
							                    potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we
							                    have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Performance of Contract</strong>&nbsp;means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong>&nbsp;means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>

							                    <strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong>

							                    <strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
							                </p>
							                <p>You have the right to:</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Request access&nbsp;</strong>to your personal data (commonly known as a &ldquo;data subject access request&rdquo;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Request correction&nbsp;</strong>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Request erasure&nbsp;</strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
							                    personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however,
							                    that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Object to processing&nbsp;</strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this
							                    ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate
							                    grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Request restriction of processing&nbsp;</strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data&rsquo;s accuracy; (b) where
							                    our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data
							                    but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Request the transfer&nbsp;</strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right
							                    only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
							                <p>
							                    <strong>Withdraw consent at any time&nbsp;</strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your
							                    consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
